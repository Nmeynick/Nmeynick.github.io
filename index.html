                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    I've spent many years working with tech in a few different roles. First I was a ran cable for a security camera company.
                    Then I was a vehicle technology specialist for a Lexus dealership for a few years. After that, I was hired into a drafting company called Rainbow Design Services,
                    where I was a CAD drafter for about 5 years. Experiences ranged in mulitple programs like Microstation, AutoCAD, and Spatial.
                    After that I worked for a short time with a company called POD, another CAD drafting company.
                    That was the end of my CAD drafting career where I took another route of a Game Techinican for Derby City Gaming, where I worked my way up to a Gaming Attendant, and where I remain as of today.

                    <p>
                        As a Lead Valey/Vehicle Technology specialist I was required to operate and maintain the service bay while providing all assistance with guests needing a run down on their vehicles.
                        I had about 3-4 valets under me and reported to multiple advisors and service managers.

                    <p>
                        I acquired many roles at Rainbow, first being a strand drafter, where you would draft out the barebones of the design. After that, I became a Coax drafter, where I added the true equipment and cable that allowed signal and communication
                        to travel to the clients. Next I would become a Fiber optics designer, which manyly focused on high raises in New York. Where I would reference splice charts with Microstation maps and spreadsheets to ensure a clean connection for the customer.
                        That lasted for some time, but eventually found myself in survey, where I would estimate and draw out builds for new customers using Spatial and Google Earth.
